# SmartPCA-Capstone
This repository contains the version 2 code for my team's Human-Centered Design &amp; Engineering (HCDE) Capstone project @ University of Washington. The code in this repository runs on a Raspberry Pi with Adafruit's 3.5" touchscreen PiTFT.

We researched, designed, prototyped, evaluated, and iterated upon a two-compartment touchscreen smart device for post-operative patients that holds and dispenses prescription opioids in one compartment and Tylenol (or other OTC pain medication) in the other while tracking dose timing and recording dose data.
